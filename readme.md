# Code usage

- For now, the code works perfectly, albeit each feature is individual without any dependency on each other. I have added examples on how to actually generate the required outputs in each file.
- using `pip install ip_adapter` is necessary but will only import the base version of the actual AI model. I have provided the zip `IP-Adapter-Instruct.zip` file of the updated version in order to make it easy to replace the base version with newest version.
- the `.bin` files for `ip-adapter-faceid`s are absolutely necessary. Without these, the code will not work.
