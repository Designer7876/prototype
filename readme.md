# Code usage

- For now, the code works perfectly, albeit each feature is individual without any dependency on each other. I have added examples on how to actually generate the required outputs in each file.
- using `pip install ip_adapter` is necessary but will only import the base version of the actual AI model. I have provided the zip `IP-Adapter-Instruct.zip` file of the updated version in order to make it easy to replace the base version with newest version.
- the `.bin` files for `ip-adapter-faceid`s are absolutely necessary. Without these, the code will not work. Below is the google drive link to those files due to their enormous size. These bin files must be in the parent folder.
